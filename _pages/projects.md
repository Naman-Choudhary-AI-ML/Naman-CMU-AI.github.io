## 1. [Open-Source GeoFNO Implementation for Irregular Geometries in PDE Solvers](/projects/project-1/)

**Introduction:**  
Partial differential equations (PDEs) are essential for simulating physical phenomena across fields such as engineering and healthcare. This project focuses on overcoming the limitations of traditional PDE solvers in handling irregular geometries. By implementing Geo-FNO within the Unified PDE Solver (UPS) framework, we aim to provide accessible and scalable simulation capabilities.

## 2. [Developing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System for Factual Question-Answering](/projects/project-2/)

**Introduction:**  
The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach integrates retrieval mechanisms with large language models (LLMs) to enhance factual question-answering. This project developed a RAG system to provide concise answers to questions about Pittsburgh and CMU, streamlining access to information within large datasets.
