{: style="text-align: justify;"}
I am a Data Scientist and Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning applications. With 1.7 years of experience as an Energy Analyst in management consulting and a current internship as a Data Scientist at O-I, I apply AI to solve real-world challenges. My goal is to become a leading problem-solver, leveraging data science and machine learning to tackle sustainability, technology, and engineering problems.

Passionate about lifelong learning, I excel at quickly adapting to new tools and techniques. My academic focus includes large language models, generative AI, and numerical methods for PDEs, aligning with my interest in bridging scientific machine learning and practical applications.

In addition to technical pursuits, I value inclusivity and collaboration, believing that diverse expertise is key to solving the world’s most pressing problems. Let’s connect to discuss innovative solutions and opportunities.
